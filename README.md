# HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION SYSTEM

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system is an application of machine learning and computer vision techniques that aim to recognize human activities from data captured through sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, on wearable devices or smartphones. HAR systems process this sensor data to identify and classify different activities performed by the wearer, such as walking, running, sitting, standing, or other activities.

The development of HAR systems is motivated by a wide range of applications, such as healthcare monitoring, sports and fitness tracking, and human-computer interaction. By accurately identifying human activities, HAR systems can provide valuable insights into individual behavior and help users to monitor and improve their health and fitness, as well as enable more natural and intuitive interactions between humans and computers.

HAR systems typically involve several stages, including data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, are commonly used for activity recognition. Data visualization techniques are also used to interpret and present the results of HAR systems.
